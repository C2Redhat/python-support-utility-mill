# A defaults file is generally organized as a dictionary of dictionaries of
# arbitrary depth with only the highest-level key 'defaults' as a requirement.
# A defaults file may include a list, which can be accessed by the below
# specified path mechanism, but to access the list contents requires manual
# processing of the list.
#
# The contents are accessed using the Defaults class specifying the path to the
# content of interest as a list of keys.  As the highest-level key 'defaults'
# is a requirement of the defaults file content the specified path is relative
# to that key; i.e. does not begin with 'defaults'.
defaults:
  global1: some-global-value
  global2: another-global-value

  # Group1 defaults:
  group1:
    default: group1-default
    subgroup1:
      default: default11
      value1: value111
      value2: value112
    subgroup2:
      default: default12
      value1: value121
      value2: value122

  # Group2 defaults:
  group2:
    default: group2-default
    subgroup1:
      default: default21
      value1: value211
      value2: value212
    subgroup2:
      default: default22
      value1: value221
      value2: value222
