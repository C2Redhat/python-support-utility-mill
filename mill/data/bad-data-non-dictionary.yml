# This is a badly formatted data file.
#
# A data file is generally organized as a dictionary of dictionaries of
# arbitrary depth with only the highest-level key 'data' as a requirement.
# A data file may include a list, which can be accessed by the below
# specified path mechanism, but to access the list contents requires manual
# processing of the list.
